			<p>The Washington Area Model United Nations Conference (WAMUNC) is a four-day exercise in diplomacy, international affairs, and global knowledge for high school delegates. Staffed by students from The George Washington University and sponsored by the International Affairs Society, WAMUNC prides itself on being one of the premier high school Model United Nations conferences in the world. With over 20 committees to choose from, delegates have the opportunity to engage with some of the world’s most pressing issues, and the wide variety of committees also allows both model UN veterans and novices to find a forum that provides a learning environment most suitable for their level. From large International Bodies to smaller ones like Historical and Specialized Bodies to Crisis Committees, every delegate can find a topic that sparks his or her interest and engage in skillful debate and negotiations with peers.</p>
			<p>Not only does WAMUNC’s uniqueness lie in its high quality simulations but also in its geographic location in the heart of Washington, D.C. Over the course of the conference’s four days, WAMUNC organizes guest speakers for committees in addition to educational excursions across the city. Leading professionals who have expertise in issues relevant to committee topics are invited to share their knowledge with the delegates, allowing them to bring new ideas and perspectives to their debates. Taking advantage of the conference’s location, WAMUNC leads excursions to embassies, think tanks, museums, and various government institutions and organizations. The learning experiences within the committees are only enhanced by the insights guest lecturers and excursions offer, and in the United States’ capital, the opportunities are endless.</p>
			<p>Throughout its 20 year history, WAMUNC has always been committed to helping delegates grow as individuals and developing the necessary skills to become the world’s next generation of leaders. Every staff member strives to foster an environment in which delegates feel comfortable challenging themselves and confident in their ability to think critically and advocate for their ideas. The model UN community is unique, and the experience it provides high school students has impacted the lives of millions of people who have had the opportunity to participate. Among those changed by the eye-opening and rewarding conferences in the high school circuit are WAMUNC staffers who, in the spirit of community and giving back, take pride in hosting the brightest students from around the world every spring.</p>
