			<p>The Washington Area Model United Nations Conference (WAMUNC) is a four-day exercise in diplomacy, international affairs, and global knowledge for high school delegates. Staffed by students from The George Washington University and sponsored by the International Affairs Society, WAMUNC prides itself on being one of the premier high school Model United Nations conferences in the world. With over 20 committees to choose from, delegates have the opportunity to engage with some of the world’s most pressing issues. The wide variety of committees allows both model UN veterans and novices to find a forum that provides a learning environment most suitable for their level. From large International Bodies to smaller ones like Historical and Specialized Bodies to Crisis Committees, every delegate can find a topic that sparks his or her interest and participate in spirited debate and negotiations with peers.</p>
			<p>WAMUNC’s uniqueness lies not only in its high quality simulations but also in its geographic location in the heart of Washington, D.C. Over the course of the conference’s four days, WAMUNC invites committee guest speakers and leads educational excursions throughout the city. Prominent professionals with vast expertise in relevant committee topics are invited to share their knowledge with the delegates, sparking new ideas and perspectives in debates. Taking advantage of the conference’s location, WAMUNC offers excursions to embassies, think tanks, museums, and a variety of government institutions and organizations. The learning experiences within the committees are only enhanced by the insights guest lecturers and excursions provide. In the United States’ capital, the opportunities are endless.</p>
			<p>As a mid-size conference, we emphasize the need to find a balance between having several opportunities, creating a competitive environment, but still preserving an atmosphere where students are not afraid to take risks and make mistakes for the sake of personal growth. While WAMUNC has grown over the years, the focus of our committees has not changed. We place our delegates first, always. Our priority is enhancing the delegate experience so that students are able to partake in a conference like no other and one that is sure to be their favorite conference yet.</p>
			<p>Throughout its 20 year history, WAMUNC has been committed to helping delegates grow and develop the necessary skills to become bold and conscientious leaders. Staff members foster an environment in which delegates feel comfortable and confident challenging themselves, thinking critically and advocating for their ideas. Many WAMUNC staffers participated in Model UN as high schoolers and take pride in passing along its legacy of diplomacy and discussion to the newer members. Model UN is an unparalleled experience that yields lifelong friendships, sparks new insights, and nurtures the desire of bright and ambitious high school students to affect positive change in the world.</p>
			<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
			<p>The Washington Area Model United Nations Conference is dedicated to promoting the development of diplomacy and knowledge of the field of international affairs amongst high school students from all over the world by providing an unparalleled conference experience that fosters personal growth in tomorrow’s leaders within a fun and engaging atmosphere.</p>
			<h2>Celebrating 20 Years of WAMUNC</h2>
			<p>As we celebrate two decades since the conception of WAMUNC, we are proud to see how much WAMUNC has grown. What started as the dream of a couple highly passionate undergraduate students from the George Washington University has gone from the small conference of a couple hundred high school delegates on GW’s campus to the 1500 delegates you will be a part of at the Wardman Park Marriott. Over the past 20 years, we are honored to say that we have had a hand in shaping over 20,000 delegates by helping nurture a passion for global affairs, public speaking, and diplomatic finesse. From delegates who call America their home to those who have traveled from as far as Greece, Turkey and China to attend WAMUNC, each delegate and advisor has helped WAMUNC become the conference it is today and for that we are thankful. You are WAMUNC and to honor that we have launched the #WeAreWAMUNC campaign for our 20th anniversary to recognize everyone who has been a part of WAMUNC in the past, present, and will continue to do so in the future.</p>
