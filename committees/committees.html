							<h4>First Committee: Disarmament and International Security</h4>
							<div class="comm-desc">
								<h3>First Committee: Disarmament and International Security</h3>
								<p>The First Committee of the General Assembly, the Disarmament and National Security Committee (DISEC), is a forum that addresses the security needs of the international community before the UN Security Council. It therefore plays a direct role in addressing concerns of armaments and global security in both the preliminary stages of multilateral diplomacy while also serving as a platform for nations to voice concerns of ongoing and developing issues that threaten stability of nations in issues such as nuclear armaments, cyber security, and space exploration. The first topic, "Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space," seeks to establish a new protocol that promotes cooperation, rather than competition and animosity for space exploration. DISEC must act as a forum and independent agent in the development and adoption of binding legal language that halts security threats while promoting interconnectivity and innovation. The second topic, "The Disarmament of Terrorist Organizations and Radical Actors in the Middle East," must work to disarm those who are unfit to wield military power, namely terrorist groups (ISIS) and the Assad regime which has used chemical weapons on its citizens, to aid the institutional campaign to rebuild the region and promote political stability.</p>

							<h4>Third Committee: Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural</h4>
							<div class="comm-desc">
								<h3>Third Committee: Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural</h3>
								<p>The Third Committee of the General Assembly, the Social, Cultural, and Humanitarian Committee (SOCHUM), deals largely with human rights issues that affect individuals all over the world. The committee covers a variety of topics that are pertinent to both developed and developing nations including the advancement of women, treatment of refugees, and the rights of indigenous populations. The first topic, "The Human Rights of Prisoners," will seek to explore the effects of overcrowding in prisons. Delegates will take into account unjust sentencing, access to fair trials, and living standards within prison facilities. The second topic, "The Economic Development of Indigenous Communities," will address the practice of large corporations infringing on indigenous lands and cultures and how the international community can help preserve indigenous culture through economic development. SOCHUM seeks to improve the life for all individuals, specifically those groups who have experienced marginalization in the past. In committee, delegates will form resolutions that not only strive to mitigate the social, cultural, and humanitarian issues at hand, but also leave a larger impact on the broader global economy, environment, and political sphere.</p>

								<h3>Fourth Committee: Special, Political, and Decolonization</h3>
								<p>The Fourth Committee of the General Assembly, the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (SPECPOL), has been tasked with some of the most sensitive political situations since its inception. From dealing with decolonization after World War II to being responsible for UN Peacekeepers, SPECPOL is imperative to maintaining international peace. The first topic, "Updating UN Standards for Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,"  looks to adjust the UN's ability to respond to the changing nature of conflict with the advent of non-state actors and cyberwarfare. The second topic, "The Role of the Law of the Sea Treaty in the South China Sea Conflict" aims to find a solution to a potentially volatile situation within the context of a key treaty in international relations. Delegates should be ready to develop creative ideas for these very complicated and pressing topics.</p>

								<h3>Sixth Committee: Legal</h3>
								<p>The Sixth Committee of the General Assembly, the Legal Committee, addresses the development of international law and ensures its continued progress as changes occur throughout the global community. The first topic, "International Law on Children," is focused on ensuring that children throughout the world are provided with rights and security. The 21st century has seen a rise in new challenges and issues dealing with children, including international adoption, child trafficking, and children in armed conflicts, leading to the importance of discussing such matters. The second topic, "Combatting International Terrorism," discusses mechanisms and legal strategies to prevent terrorists from gaining economic and technological resources which they use to commit violence throughout the globe. The Legal Committee will seek to develop long-term solutions to improve the international legal structure while at the same time respecting the sovereignty of all nations.</p>

							<h4>Commission on the Status of Women</h4>
							<div class="comm-desc">
								<h3>Commission on the Status of Women</h3>
								<p>The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women serves as a functional commission of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Every year, Member States meet to evaluate progress on gender equality, identify challenges and global obstacles, set global standards, and formulate concrete policies for the advancement of women and promotion of gender equality. During committee, topics we will be debating include the political empowerment of women, and bodily autonomy. Both topics highlight different worlds of gender equality. Having the full right to one’s own body and access to healthcare is just as important as the opportunities women need to be active in their civic duty. As a body, finding solutions to tackle global gender equality issues and fundamental human rights issues are of utmost concern.</p>

							<h4>Council of the European Union</h4>
							<div class="comm-desc">
								<h3>Council of the European Union</h3>
								<p>The CoEU is a legislating, intergovernmental body of the EU. The Foreign Affairs Configuration (FAC) consists of the ministers of Foreign Affairs of each country and when it discusses the CSDP it can include Defense ministers as well. The presidency of the CoEU rotates among countries and in 2018 the presidency will be held by Bulgaria. Since the presidency largely influences the agenda, topics would include “ensuring political stability in the Western Balkans” and “US-EU bilateral relations and co-operation.” Delegates will have the great opportunity to discuss engaging and relevant topics while trying to overcome the numerous problems imposed by Europeandecision-making rules, namely by the need for unanimity. Delegates might find that achieving a compromise while also implementing an effective solution is indeed an impossible task, thus understanding better the chronic inertia and lack of boldness that seems to plague the EU.</p>

							<h4>Committee on Peaceful Uses of Space</h4>
							<div class="comm-desc">
								<h3>Committee on Peaceful Uses of Space</h3>
								<p>The Committee on the Peaceful uses of Space (COPUOS) governs the exploration and use of space for all United Nations member states. The two topics that delegates will focus on are defining “peaceful uses of space” and regulating military aggression in space. Topic A, defining “peaceful uses of space” addresses the lack of clarity and a universal definition of peace in space. Currently, each member state establishes its own definition; however these definitions lack unity and cover a wide range of regulations and limitations. Topic B addresses how to regulate aggression in space, and more specifically delegates will establish detailed guidelines for the implementation and protection of new advancements in outer space in order to ensure the continuation of the international dedication to non-militarization and peace in space. By addressing these two topics, delegates will gain an understanding of the rising importance of space as a realm of both national defense and scientific exploration.</p>

							<h4>African Union</h4>

								<h3>African Union</h3>
								<p>The African Union (AU) is a political union of the 55 countries that make up the African continent. The AU was formed on May 26th, 2001 as a successor to the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which existed from May 25th, 1963 to July 9th, 2002 and worked to promote decolonization and end Apartheid in South Africa. The AU is based in Addis Ababa—the capital of Ethiopia—and works to promote peace, prosperity, democracy, human rights, and sovereignty of African states. The AU has made strides in combating terrorist groups, promoting development, and even has plans for a unified African currency system—much like the European Union’s Euro—in the 2030s. The AU is challenged by systemic problems such as underfunding, pandemics, and corruption, but has many prospects for development and the betterment of the Africa.</p>

								<p>In the United Nations Environmental Program committee, we will be tackling some of the massive, complex challenges facing our planet. To address these multistakeholder issues, members of this committee will need to think big, plan strategically, compromise, and set ambitious but achievable goals. Through the forum of UNEP, the world has come together to create monumental agreements like the Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Biodiversity, and the Paris Climate Accords. This year, the UNEP committee will have the chance to create another legendary environmental agreement on the topics of changing consumption patterns or improving the status of women worldwide. We hope you're up to the challenge- Earth and all of its inhabitants are depending on you!</p>

							<h4>1177 BC: The Year Civilization Collapsed</h4>
							<div class="comm-desc">
								<h3>1177 BC: The Year Civilization Collapsed</h3>
								<p>The 12th century BCE was a period of utter turmoil in the Eastern Mediterranean that saw the demise of nearly every complex society from Egypt to the Aegean. Dozens of theories attempt to explain but fail to fully interpret the fall of the civilized world as the period remains shrouded in horrific violence, shocking climate events, and intriguing diplomatic and personal narratives. Delegates will each represent a kingdom, city state, or independent polity as they attempt to work together to navigate the challenges of the 12th century. Delegates will be tasked with responding to calamitous natural disasters; collapse of established political dynasties; climate change, drought, and famine; invasions of foreign populations known collectively as 'The Sea People;' and globalizing economies and methods of warfare. While no previous knowledge of the time period is required, delegates who prepare well, grasp a firm historical perspective, and think quickly on their toes are most likely to successfully maneuver through the many challenges the committee will encounter. Will the committee be able to fortuitously and promptly respond to the hazards of the end of the bronze age or will they, true to history, face collapse?</p>

The department’s executive department is divided into civilian and uniformed divisions. The civilian staff, also known as the Office of the Police Commissioner, is responsible for support services and departmental management. The department’s uniformed division is responsible for criminal investigations and law enforcement. In this committee, delegates will simulate the administrative leadership responsible for oversight of NYPD operations. Delegates will represent head officials from the Offices of the Police Commissioner, Chief of Departments, and Inspector General.</p>

An emphasis will be placed upon delevolpment of a wide-ranging understanding of the problems, considering environmental, geopolotical economic and social factors, among others. Overall, delegates should expect to develop a deep understanding of both topics for a successful committee, including understanding past successes and failures in addressing these issues. Finally, delegates should expect to discuss the commitments that the country they represent can make, and what steps they can reasonably take to target the problems in their own country.</p>

							<h4>Democratic National Committee War Room</h4>

								<h3>Democratic National Committee War Room</h3>
								<p>After the election of 2016, the Democratic party is reeling from its unexpected loss of both the Presidency and the Senate. Their messaging, campaign tactics, and policies have been rejected by the American electorate. The DNC now must convene an emergency War Room to help strategize and plan for the 2018 midterm elections and reshape the party’s image. Not only do the Democrats have the rise of the Republicans to deal with, but the internal fractures caused by the intense primary battle between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have not healed. This War Room will be made up of prominent party officials, legislators, and former government bureaucrats that all believe they have the answers for the future of the Democratic Party. The main objectives of this committee will be to shape the Democratic Party Platform for 2018, strategize on how to regain electoral districts that were lost to both the Tea Party Wave of 2010 and the ‘Trump Train’ in 2016, and to settle the factional warfare within the party. The War Room will also be receiving regular updates about the goings on of the world around them, simulating the passage of time until the election of 2018.</p>

								<p>In 1959, the Tibetan people faced a seemingly impossible choice. With increasing tensions between the regime in Beijing and the autonomous Tibetan government lead by the Dalai Lama, violence appeared imminent on the streets of Lhasa. In this committee, delegates handle the difficult moral decision of whether to collaborate with an invading army or risk the lives of thousands in the name of resistance. Participants will attempt to steer Tibet’s fate through this turbulent period of grassroots rebellion, religious fracturing and political unrest. In this way, delegates will learn that every action has consequences, and even conflicts that appear black-and-white tend to be grayer than they appear.</p>

								<h3>Ad Hoc Committee of the Secretary General</h3>
								<p>The Ad Hoc committee has been a staple of WAMUNC for many years and is one of the most unique Model UN experiences a delegate can ever have. Designed for the best and brightest delegates on the high school circuit, the framework of an Ad Hoc Committee is such that the actual topic of debate along with positions will be given to the delegates during the first session of WAMUNC and as such this committee will require incredible amounts of creativity and critical thinking. Though reading materials may be released for this committee prior to WAMUNC, there will be no indication in them for what the committee is actually simulating or who the characters in the committee are. This committee is designed for veteran Model UN delegates who have preferably had crisis experience in the past; club presidents and juniors and seniors with prior competition experience are the ideal candidates.</p>

							<h4>2013 Egyptian Coup d'etat</h4>
							<div class="comm-desc">
								<h3>2013 Egyptian Coup d'etat</h3>
								<p>Committee will begin in November 2012, following the election of Mohamed Morsi to the Egyptian presidency. The change in regime has led to national instability while the military's power and influence in the economy and government (a true ‘deep state’) begins to present a rival to power, threatening the stability of the still nascent government. Much of the region and world, moreover, views the Brotherhood with deep skepticism if not outright hostility and, in the face of these pressures, the Brotherhood has responded with various attempts to consolidate power, leading to accusations of authoritarianism and illiberalism. Faced with this multi-pronged instability, delegates will be forced to keep a floundering nation on track in the eyes of the military, its people, and the global community, having the opportunity to react in real time to the actions of the military, attempting to seize power, and the people, seeking fair and just governance. Delegates will be largely in control of the direction of committee: debating the merits of the democratic process, the accountability of Morsi, and the possibility of a military coup. This committee will not only give delegates a chance to play out and, potentially, alter these historic events but will provide an opportunity for an engaging, meaningful, and fun crisis committee that will uphold the legacy of WAMUNC.</p>

Members of the Principals Committee will be tasked with finding both short term and long term policy solutions to pressing issues on domestic counterterrorism, intelligence gathering, immigration, cyber defense, nuclear policy, environmental security policy and more, while also responding to immediate crisis threats. The fate of the country (and the world!) lies in the your ability to decipher intelligence materials, track terrorist networks, and make strategic and timely decisions, while using the unique resources at each principal's disposal to authentically simulate the structure of the NSC.</p>

								<p>The year is 1180. Under the rule of the Leper King Baldwin IV, the Kingdom of Jerusalem is on the brink of ruin, as the Ayyubid Sultan Saladin prepares to invades the kingdom and retake Jerusalem from the crusaders, while within the kingdom political factions squabble over who will succeed the dying king. As a lord on the Council of the Crusader Lords of Jerusalem, your mission will be to defend the kingdom against the ever present threat of Saladin ad find a way to secure the succession to the throne without the kingdom falling into chaos and civil war. Given how the Kingdom is surrounded by enemies both within and without, only through skillful negotiation and bold ideas will you be able to save the Kingdom of Jerusalem. This committee presents an opportunity to not only explore the history of the Crusader States, but also to understand how the period influences the current turbulent situation in the holy land.</p>

								<h3>Starfleet High Command, 2364 (Star Trek)</h3>
								<p>The year is 2364- It is a time of great prosperity for the United Federation of Planets, but great strife as well, and strong leaders are needed to guide it. In this committee, delegates will take charge of the Federation as members of Starfleet Command, and shape the course of galactic events as they see fit. Using diplomacy and military force as they choose, they will navigate a web of threats and ethical dilemmas ranging from initiating First Contact to dealing with potential enemies in the Romulans and Cardassians, and fairweather friends in the Klingons. Delegates will also have to seek to fulfill the spirit of Starfleet's Prime Directive at all times, refraining from interfering in the development of other civilizations- or pretend to, at least. The Alpha and Beta Quadrants are a treacherous place, and pursuing one's own personal agenda through subterfuge and secret alliances can have lucrative rewards. Beyond the scope of the committee room, though, the Federation and Starfleet share inherent similarities with the United Nations and its own mission, making this committee all the more relevant to the real world, as delegates are forced to find diplomatic solutions to complex problems with no obvious answers.</p>

In this committee, delegates will represent the wealthy Robber Barons that ruled America, and shift the course of the nation. With that great power will come great responsibility- delegates will have the power to manipulate events across the country. Delegates will gain perspective on the unofficial oligarchy that still impacts America today, and become fully immersed in the politics and intrigue of the era and live through history.</p>

								<h3>Obama's Advisory Committee</h3>
								<p>When Obama stepped into office in 2009, the U.S. was clearly on the verge of major change. The Great Recession was in full swing, we still had troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Affordable Care Act was still just an idea. The new president had pledged to improve conditions for minorities, improve education, keep the U.S. safe from terrorism, pass comprehensive immigration reform, and close Guantanamo Bay. His cabinet and other close advisors played a crucial role in the decisions Obama needed to make and the following years were shaped by every choice he made from the economy to Special Ops missions. This committee will be faced with issues ranging from healthcare to immigration reform. From senior White House staff members, to cabinet secretaries, to top U.S. government officials, this crisis committee will consist of some of America's most well-known politicians and individuals who shaped the administration from behind the curtains.</p>

							<h4>JCC: Monday Night Wars (WWF vs. WCW)</h4>

								<h3>JCC: Monday Night Wars (WWF vs. WCW)</h3>
								<p>In the late 1990s, two wrestling companies went to war over television ratings on Monday nights: WWF, owned by Vince McMahon Jr., and WCW, backed by media giant Ted Turner. But the two weren’t just focused on profits; they were notoriously egotistical, and undertook shady business practices from poaching talent to spoiling each other’s broadcasts in order to embarrass the other. The competition between the organizations fueled their popularity, and for a few years, professional wrestling was at the forefront of pop culture.</p>
