	    <p style="text-indent: 0;">Dear Delegates and Faculty Advisors,</p>
		<p>It is my absolute pleasure to welcome you to the 20th anniversary of the Washington Area Model United Nations Conference located in the heart of the nation's capital, Washington D.C. and hosted by the George Washington University's International Affairs Society. This year's conference will be held from Thursday, March 1st to Sunday, March 4th, 2018 at the Marriott Wardman Park. Our Secretariat is thrilled to invite you to join us at WAMUNC this spring.</p>
		<p>This major milestone marks two decades of our annual conference that brings together the brightest and most ambitious high school students from not just across the United States of America, but also international schools in Mexico, Greece, Turkey, Taiwan, South Africa, and beyond. WAMUNC is an opportunity for these students to engage in meaningful debate, write resolutions to real world issues, and sculpt their diplomatic skills. However, it also creates an avenue for lasting friendships and provides a holistic experience with the unparalleled access it gives its delegates to D.C.'s world-renowned monuments and institutions.</p>
		<p>Over the past twenty years, WAMUNC has gone from a budding conference located on GWU's college campus into the bustling conference you know today, with 1300 delegates in attendence and over 200 GW students acting as Staff. However, year to year, what has not changed is our love for providing the best possible experience for our high school delegates.</p>
		<p>At WAMUNC you will find Chairs, Crisis Directors, and Staff who are passionate about their committees, topics, and providing the best possible experience for our delegates. Our Staff is selected for their experience, knowledge, dedication, and enthusiasm. WAMUNC's top-notch committees stem from months of careful planning leading up to the days of the conference. From the difficult to navigate waters of our larger International Bodies to the fast paced boardrooms of our Crisis Committees, you will find a wide range of exciting topics for all delegates that have been meticulously vetted with great attention to detail.</p>
		<p>Our conference gives delegates the chance to explore the world of international diplomacy within the four walls of the Marriott Wardman Park. With the guidance of their Chairs and Crisis Directors, these students will walk away on Sunday with the tools to forge a path for themselves as public speakers, negotiators, and world leaders. WAMUNC strives to unveil aspects of your creativity, perseverance, and confidence that you did not know existed.</p>
		<p>I entered the world of Model United Nations as a timid ninth grader. At my very first conference I did not utter a word. But seven years from that day I can truly say that Model UN has opened doors for me. It taught me to be a more confident, capable, and globally aware version of myself and it is my hope that WAMUNC will do the same for each and every one of you.</p>
		<p>Thus, I invite you to apply for WAMUNC XX and I sincerely hope that you will join us this Spring for what is sure to be an exciting and engaging weekend. Please carefully read and take note of our deadlines and financial policies as outlined on the WAMUNC website. If you have any questions at all, the WAMUNC Secretariat and I would be more than happy to answer them, so please feel free to reach out to us.</p>
		<p>I look forward to seeing both familiar and new faces at WAMUNC XX in March!</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 0;">Warmest Regards,</p>
